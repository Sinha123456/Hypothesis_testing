# Hypothesis_testing

**Hypothesis:**

**Boneferroni correction:** 

When performing more than one hypothesis test, your type I error compounds. In order to correct for this, 
a common technique is called the Bonferroni correction. This correction is very conservative, but says that your new type I error rate
should be the error rate you actually want divided by the number of tests you are performing.

bonferroni correction = alpha/m, m = no. of test

**Alpha:** The threshold for the percent of type I errors we are willing to commit.

**P-Value:** The probability of observing our statistic or a more extreme statistic from the null hypothesis.

**Other errors:**

**Null Hypothesis:** What we assume to be true before collecting any data.

Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, these statistical techniques are generally aimed at helping us understand population parameters.
